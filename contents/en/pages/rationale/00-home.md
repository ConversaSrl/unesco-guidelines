#  Barriers to digital inclusion



Almost half the world’s population is online, which is a major achievement. However, there is still much work to be done. Those already online often do not fully utilize the potential of the internet. Those still offline, the 4 billion potential users, look different from those already benefitting from digital opportunities. Globally, the offline population is disproportionately rural, poor, elderly and female. Offline people often have limited education, low literacy (Sprague et al., 2014) and typically hold informal-sector jobs. To increase digital inclusion, fundamentally different strategies are needed.

There are four major barriers to digital inclusion (Schmida et al., 2017) which require a holistic response: lack of infrastructure, low incomes and affordability, limited user capabilities, and lack of incentives to go online.

While it is critical to address the first two barriers, they largely fall outside of the scope of these guidelines. Limited user capabilities are seen in the 750 million people who cannot read or write (Montoya, 2017) and the many more who are semi-literate. Beyond literacy abilities, most adults in low- and middle-income countries do not have even basic digital skills and competences (UNESCO, 2017). Across Africa, seven in ten people who do not use the internet say they just don’t know how to use it (World Bank, 2016). Even in Europe, 19 per cent of adults lack the literacy skills, and 45 per cent lack the basic digital skills, needed to function fully in a modern society (OECD, 2016).


Lack of incentives is another factor. This includes limited cultural and social acceptance of internet use, low awareness and understanding of the internet, and not enough available and relevant local content.
Of course people who are low-literate and low- skilled do not constitute a homogeneous group, and each person does not exhibit all of the offline attributes. However, it is useful to recognize key characteristics of this group.
While the major barriers need to be addressed in a holistic manner, a two-pronged approach is needed: to simultaneously design relevant and usable digital solutions that are inclusive of the full range of skill levels of users, and also work on improving the education, literacy and digital skills of users.


# Reasons for focusing on low-skilled and low-literate people


In the digital age, more than ever, literacy is the critical first step in the lifelong learning journey to improved quality of life, livelihood and work. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) devote renewed attention to the **importance of literacy** by aiming to ensure that all young people and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy by 2030 (target 4.6).
